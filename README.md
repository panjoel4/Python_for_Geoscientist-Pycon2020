# Python for Geoscientist: Machine Learning and Beyond!
This repository is the supplementary files from my latest talk at Python Conference 2020. I hope that you could playing around with the examples given on the talks.

## Jupyter Notebook and Data
For you who are interested in the jupyter notebook of the code you can check on the ipynb folder.
The Las file of the well log are available at the data folder, while the segY for the seismic is available [here.](https://dataunderground.org/dataset/f3)

## Curie Point Depth Mapping example
For this case, I am not able to share the jupyter. The proccess took a while to generate, and this was not ran on jupyter notebook back in the day. However, you could still copy the full code from my MSc thesis [here.](http://essay.utwente.nl/83453/1/qudsi.pdf)
