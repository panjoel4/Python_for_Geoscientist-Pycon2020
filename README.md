# Python for Geoscientist: Machine Learning and Beyond!
This repository is the supplementary files from my latest talk at Python Conference 2020. I hope that you could playing around with the examples given on the talks. The recording of the talk could be watched here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbGt4QXZ5Hs

## Jupyter Notebook and Data
For you who are interested in the jupyter notebook of the code you can check on the ipynb folder.
The Las file of the well log are available at the data folder, while the segY for the seismic is available [here.](https://dataunderground.org/dataset/f3)

## Curie Point Depth Mapping example
For this case, I am not able to share the jupyter. The proccess took a while to generate, and this was not ran on jupyter notebook back in the day. However, you could still copy the full code from my MSc thesis [here.](http://essay.utwente.nl/83453/1/qudsi.pdf)

## Python-based Software
Here are several links to the software that was mentioned during the talk. Of course there are plenty of other software that I couldn't mention, if you find the interesting one, kindly update this list below.
* [Geoapps - Mira Geoscience](https://mirageoscience.com/geoh5py-and-geoapps-pypi/)
* [HypPy - Hyperspectral Python](https://blog.utwente.nl/bakker/hyppy/) and [Frank's Tutorial](https://frankstutorials.nl/) to get the dataset also tutorial about hyperspectral imagery.
* [Gempy - Open-source 3D geological modelling](https://www.gempy.org/)
* [pyGIMLi - Geophysical Inversion & Modelling Library](https://www.pygimli.org/)
* [pyLEFA - LEFA GIS Tools](http://lefa.geologov.net/download-2/pylefa/)

## Implementation on Database Management System (Bonus)
Unfortunately, I couldn't attach the code for the implementation on database management system. This is the property of my current company, so releasing the code is not possible. However, you can still see what we have done using python on our company page [here](http://horizon-perdana.co.id/products/hope-solution/) or you can click this thumbnail below, to watch the video of one of our portfolio.

## Book Recommendation
I remember that someone asked me about book recommendation which I wasn't able to recall back in the talk, this is the [link](https://www.elsevier.com/books/machine-learning-guide-for-oil-and-gas-using-python/belyadi/978-0-12-821929-4) to the book that you might want to read.
